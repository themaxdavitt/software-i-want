# Software I want

An incomplete list of software that I want but do not have the time/knowledge to develop.

This is a living document. Feel free to suggest features and software in the [issues tab](https://github.com/themaxdavitt/software-i-want/issues).

## Smart well-integrated standards-based [PIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management) suite

Basically, I want something that does what the [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) or [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com)/[NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com) frontends do, but in a simpler and more modular way. Like the relevant applications from the [Simple Mobile Tools](https://www.simplemobiletools.com) suite, but more connected, feature-rich, and with desktop support. I want to be able to use [CalDav + CardDav](https://www.calconnect.org/resources/getting-started/caldav-and-carddav) to their fullest extents, but without feeling like I have to adopt large, complex solutions.

I'm not quite sure how the parts of this suite should look or integrate with other tools. I have yet to try the [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface) "solution" of [`aerc`](https://aerc-mail.org/) (for email) + [`khal`](https://lostpackets.de/khal/) (calendar) + [`khard`](https://khard.readthedocs.io) (contacts) + [`todoman`](https://todoman.readthedocs.io) (tasks) + [`vdirsyncer`](https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org) (soft "dependency" for all except `aerc`) - it's appealing to me, but besides `aerc`, the other programs all have strict scopes, hurting their potential for integration (e.g. not supporting [iCalendar's `VTODO`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.6.2)s in `khal`, see [pimutils/khal#10](https://github.com/pimutils/khal/issues/10) and [pimutils/khal#448](https://github.com/pimutils/khal/issues/448)). Something worth noting is that the author of `aerc` mentioned in the introductory video on his tool's website that he was interested in adding support for these kinds of things in the future though.

I'm most interested in finding a good standards-based solution for task management (hence why I used the `khal` issue as an example) - I want something that I can use to plan out tasks with respect to my calendar so that I use my time more efficiently (helping me link "do" and "due" dates, blending task and time management). I want some "smart" features of modern equivalents (e.g. [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com), [Todoist](https://todoist.com), ...), namely time estimation, [smart scheduling](https://web.archive.org/web/20190319214115/https://doist.com/blog/todoist-smart-schedule/), and [shorthand syntax](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answer/basics-smartadd-whatis), but if the tools are designed with extensibility and interoperability in mind, most things provided by those equivalents would be handled using auxiliary tools and scripts (e.g. alarms/notifications for events). An honorable mention for this specific want is [`todo.txt`](http://todotxt.org), but I'd really prefer to stay within this ecosystem of standards for compatibility reasons, so I'm not considering it a contender for this suite.

## Cheap easy-to-use "devtool-inspired" websites for non-developers

To knowledgable web developers, creating and deploying a fast, efficient website for cheap is barely a weekend project. There's a number of modern technologies that can be used to host something simple for less than the cost of a latte a month:

- Cloud storage (e.g. [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/), [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [GCP Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/), all around \~$0.02/GB/month for storage + \~$0.10/GB for bandwidth)
- Serverless functions (e.g. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/), [GCP Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/), [Cloudflare Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/sites), costs can be hard to estimate for mere mortals but will be cheap for low-to-medium traffic)
- Generic developer-oriented hosting services (e.g. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) \*, [free for public repos](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility#making-a-repository-private), and [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/), [which follows CDN/storage-like pricing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/usage-quotas-pricing))
- Hard-to-describe monolithic "web project" platforms (e.g. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) to a slightly lesser extent, both can be used freely for this but their enterprise offerings get spicy fast)

I asterisked what I'd describe as "devtools" - they're examples of platforms where bizdev decisions were made to optimize convenience for developers in a way that would lock them in using sexy, modern _but actually relatively cheap_ technologies. I don't want people getting locked in though. When I say "devtool-inspired" I mean creating tools that are as convenient for non-developers to create and deploy websites using the same technologies. This is close to what [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) (maintained by the same Netlify I just talked shit about) is trying to do, but it's still far too technical for someone to setup - just the thought of comparing the processes from [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com), and [Wix](https://www.wix.com) to [theirs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/) (ignoring [their "Templates" ~~ad~~ page](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/)) reminds me of [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9224).
